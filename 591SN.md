# Network Coding for Critical Infra Networks 
###### By Rakesh Kumar

Programmable Data Planes: Old chip supports new protocols.
PISA Vs ASIC -- PISA uses P4 language.
Using P4 language to do Network Coding Operations. 
Sending a new packet, which is a XOR/combination of incoming packets

Min(Max flow) throughput is guaranteed using NC
Throughput increases in NC. 
Store & Forward requires combinatorial solvers
Coding at application level is hard for application -- so use programmable data plane
Diversity Coding
