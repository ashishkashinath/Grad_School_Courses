We used a variety of tools in order to hack the network. We started by using aircrack to obtain the WEP newtork password. From there we logged onto the network and used Wireshark to look at the packets and then we played around with ARPspoof to redirect the packets towards ourself and we used nmap to scan the network and determine that 192.168.1.100 was the server and 192.168.1.105 was the client but since the packets were still encrypted with ssl we ended up using ettercap and after we configured it properly to do the ARP poisoning and DNS spoofing, we were able to read the traffic being sent by the client and steal the password and username.
